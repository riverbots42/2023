# OrangePi Zero-Based Wifi-Controlled Fan

## Introduction

The [OrangePi Zero](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-Zero-LTS.html) is a tiny,
ARM-based single-board-computer (SBC) that has roughly the power of a 2012-era cellphone.  It comes with:

* A quad-core 32-bit ARM processor
* 256MB of RAM
* Boots from a MicroSD card
* An ethernet port and a Wifi interface
* A ton of general-purpose IO (GPIO) and other electrical interfaces for y'all to play with :-)

Given this year's FRC "Energize" theme, we'll be powering this device from a Lithium-Ion rechargable battery and using it to create
a wifi-controlled micro fan.

## Electronics

The basic schematic is as follows:
